          <p>"After giving it a lot of consideration, we made the decision to purchase a share into Vintage Cooperative of Prairie Trail. The Coop offers a maintenance-free alternative to home ownership that is uniquely different from other housing options. We feel safe and secure living in our cooperative community. Living in the Coop provides us with a neighborly environment and a sense of family. If we need anything, all we have to do is knock on our neighbor’s door and they are more than happy to help us. We travel 7 months out-of-a-year, so we have the comfort of knowing someone is checking our unit and getting our mail. We enjoy the surrounding community that provides us with walking trails, restaurants, shopping, movie theater and library."

          <p>"My wife and I recently retired and made the decision we wanted to do something with our time other than maintaining our large home.  We looked at a few Condo's & a few Cooperative Communities.  We decided to sell our home & use the equity to purchase an apartment at Vintage Cooperative of Prairie Trail.  We love the Prairie Trail neighborhood.  Walking distance to restaurants, new library, fitness center and other vital facilities.  Both of us have recumbent trikes and I love to play golf.  We can get on a bike trail 50 ft from our garage, and I have several choices of golf courses within 10 miles.   We now have plenty of time to do the things we enjoy as no more lawns to mow or snow to scoop!  We feel it is important to be involved in our cooperative community, so we are members of 3 different committees that make decisions regarding our "home"."

          <p>"When we decided to move to Ankeny to be near our children and grandchildren, we were not sure if we wanted to live in an apartment, condo, cooperative or another house. Our daughter who lives in Ankeny scoped out the possibilities for us and sent us folders about various living options. When we read about Vintage Cooperative of Prairie Trail. We knew that we wanted to that we wanted to visit this facility. On our second visit and tour our 3 children went with us. We were all so impressed with the spacious well-cared for units and the beauty of the common areas. We loved the idea of ownership in a cooperative rather than renting. This independent living facility provides a maintenance-free, secure lifestyle that we are so thankful for. Potlucks, coffees, games, and activities are welcomed by all. The woodshop located in the garage is outfitted with tools and equipment that keep the gentleman in our family (and others) entertained and productive. When we moved in, the moment we parked our car in the heated underground garage, we met several of our new neighbors who quickly became our friends. We knew we had made the right decision!"
